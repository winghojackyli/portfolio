              Hi, my name is Jacky and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivated"}</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold">{" driven"}</span> software engineer
              based in Vancouver, BC.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I completed my studies at Douglas College in 2023, achieving a
              Post-baccalaureate Diploma in Computer & Information Technology.
              Since then, I have been actively engaged in the industry,
              leveraging my education. Furthermore, I hold a BSc in Chemistry
              from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I find myself engrossed in various hobbies and interests. These
              include playing sports, traveling, and staying active by engaging
              in activities such as running, going to the gym, and swimming.
              Moreover, I have a strong enthusiasm for learning and consistently
              seeking out new knowledge.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I hold the belief that{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                continuous growth is paramount
              </span>
              , and this principle is what I actively pursue. Fueled by a fervor
              for technology, I am driven to consistently challenge the
              boundaries of what can be achieved. The anticipation of the
              unfolding path of my career fills me with excitement, and I remain
              receptive to fresh prospects and opportunities that may arise. ðŸ˜Š
